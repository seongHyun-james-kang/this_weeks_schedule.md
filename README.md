Daily Schedule I work full time and 55+hrs a week. 
It is very hard to find time to study during weekdays. 
I try to focus more during weekends

I aim to...

Mon 7pm -11pm

Tue 7pm -11pm Wed 7pm -11pm

Thu 7pm -11pm

Fri 7pm -11pm

Sat 8am -2pm

Sun 7pm -11pm

But realistically during weekdays is really hard because I work overtime...
It's very hard to control my time.
